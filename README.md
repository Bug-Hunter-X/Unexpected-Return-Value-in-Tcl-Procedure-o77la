This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: unexpected return values from procedures. The `bug.tcl` file contains code with an unexpected return value, and `bugSolution.tcl` shows the corrected version. The issue arises when a procedure performs actions (like printing) that implicitly return a value, which might conflict with an explicit `return` statement, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in other parts of your Tcl script.
